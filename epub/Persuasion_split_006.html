<div class="calibre5">Since concluding the above remarks, the writer of them has been put in possession of some extracts from the private correspondence of the authoress. They are few and short; but are submitted to the public without an apology, as being more truly descriptive of her temper, taste, feelings, and principles than any thing which the pen of a biographer can produce.</div>
<div class="calibre3">The first extract is a playful defence of herself from a mock charge of having pilfered the manuscripts of a young relation.</div>
<div class="calibre3">“What should I do, my dearest E. with your manly, vigorous sketches, so full of life and spirit? How could I possibly join them on to a little bit of ivory, two inches wide, on which I work with a brush so fine as to produce little effect after much labour?”</div>
<div class="calibre3">The remaining extracts are from various parts of a letter written a few weeks before her death.</div>
<div class="calibre3">“My attendant is encouraging, and talks of making me quite well. I live chiefly on the sofa, but am allowed to walk from one room to the other. I have been out once in a sedan-chair, and am to repeat it, and be promoted to a wheel-chair as the weather serves. On this subject I will only say further that my dearest sister, my tender, watchful, indefatigable nurse, has not been made ill by her exertions. As to what I owe to her, and to the anxious affection of all my beloved family on this occasion, I can only cry over it, and pray to God to bless them more and more.”</div>
<div class="calibre3">She next touches with just and gentle animadversion on a subject of domestic disappointment. Of this the particulars do not concern the public. Yet in justice to her characteristic sweetness and resignation, the concluding observation of our authoress thereon must not be suppressed.</div>
<div class="calibre3">“But I am getting too near complaint. It has been the appointment of God, however secondary causes may have operated.”</div>
<div class="calibre3">The following and final extract will prove the facility with which she could correct every impatient thought, and turn from complaint to cheerfulness.</div>
<div class="calibre3">“You will find Captain ——— a very respectable, well-meaning man, without much manner, his wife and sister all good humour and obligingness, and I hope (since the fashion allows it) with rather longer petticoats than last year.”</div>
